Title: Tomato Soup with Arugula, Croutons, and Pecorino
Instructions: Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss bread with 2 tablespoons oil on a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt. Bake, tossing halfway through, until golden brown and crunchy, 8–10 minutes; set croutons aside.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium. Add onion, garlic, and thyme; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until onion is soft, 5–7 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring often, until they just start to release their juices, about 1 minute. Add 1 cup water and bring to a boil. Transfer tomato mixture to a blender and blend until smooth; taste and add hot sauce to your liking. Season with salt and pepper.
Drizzle soup with more oil and top with arugula, Pecorino, and croutons.
Croutons can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.
