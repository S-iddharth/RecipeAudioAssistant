Title: Pizza Pouches
Instructions: 1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
2. Roll the dough out about ¼ inch thick. Cut it into eighths (2 will be left over).
3. Grease a 6-cup muffin tin. Line each cup with a piece of dough, letting the excess hang over the sides.
4. Fill each with 1 tablespoon of sauce and 1 meatball. Divide the cheeses equally among the cups.
5. Gather each bit of excess dough up around the filling, pinching it together at the top.
6. Whisk the egg with the milk to make a wash. Brush it onto each pouch.
7. Bake until golden, 15 to 20 minutes.
