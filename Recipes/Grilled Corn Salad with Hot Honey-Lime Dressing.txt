Title: Grilled Corn Salad with Hot Honey-Lime Dressing
Instructions: Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Brush ears of corn with butter; season with salt and pepper. Grill, turning occasionally, until kernels are very tender and charred in spots, 10â€“12 minutes. Let cool slightly, then cut kernels from cobs.
Meanwhile, whisk lime juice, honey, Sriracha, granulated garlic, and 1 1/2 tsp. salt in a large bowl to combine. Add corn, avocados, chile, and cilantro to vinaigrette and toss to combine; season with salt and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing in direct contact with salad to prevent avocados from turning brown. Chill at least 2 hours.
Salad can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.
