Title: Instant Pot Butternut Squash Hash
Instructions: In the Instant Pot, combine the butternut squash, a pinch each of salt and pepper, and the olive oil. Set to “sauté, medium heat” and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes, stirring often to avoid burning. Add the onion and bell pepper and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the paprika, chili powder, rosemary, and garlic and toss to combine. Hit “cancel.”
Make 2 wells in the hash and crack the eggs into the wells. Cover, choose the “egg” setting, and cook for 1 minute. Quick-release the pressure and serve.
